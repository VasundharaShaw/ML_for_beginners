# Fun with Machine Learning  

This is a **fun open repository** for anyone who is trying to pick up the basics of Machine Learning using **scikit-learn**, and later on **PyTorch**.  

üëâ Recommended starting point: try the **classify-flower** notebook.  

For a general understanding of neural networks, it is highly recommended to watch the excellent **Neural Networks Playlist by 3Blue1Brown**:
